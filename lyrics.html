            When I lift my hands to You, <br />
            You never let go <br />
            When the waters overwhelm me <br />
            Your blood, it protects me and it lifts me up and sets me on higher

      <p> I love You Lord
        <br />Oh Your mercy never fails me <br />All my days <br />I’ve been
        held in Your hands <br />From the moment that I wake up <br />Until I
        lay my head <br />I will sing of the goodness of God</p>
